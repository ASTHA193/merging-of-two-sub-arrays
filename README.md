# Merging of two sub arrays
 A C program which is used to merge two arrays acccordingly .
Because we're using divide-and-conquer to sort, we need to decide what our subproblems are going to look like. The full problem is to sort an entire array. Let's say that a subproblem is to sort a subarray. In particular, we'll think of a subproblem as sorting the subarray starting at index p pp and going through index r rr. It will be convenient to have a notation for a subarray, so let's say that array[p..r] denotes this subarray of array. Note that this "two-dot" notation is not legal JavaScript; we're using it just to describe the algorithm, rather than a particular implementation of the algorithm in code. In terms of our notation, for an array of n nn elements, we can say that the original problem is to sort array[0..n-1].
